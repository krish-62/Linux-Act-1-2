Linux Homework – Activities 1 & 2

This repository contains my Linux homework.

Activity 1:  
  I explored different `ls` command options (from `-b` to `-z`), learned basic navigation commands like `whoami`, `pwd`, `cd`, and used the `tree` command with different depth levels.  
  Each command is written with a description, sample output, and my remarks.

  Activity 2:  
  I worked on more `tree` command options (`-a`, `-d`, `-u`, `-p`) and also tried some networking commands like `ifconfig`, `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nmap`. I also used `mkdir` to create directories.  
  Same format: command → description → output → remarks.


How I did it
  Ran each command on my Linux terminal.  
  Noted down what it does (description).  
  Copied the sample output.  
  Added my own remarks (what I understood from the output).  
  Uploaded everything here to GitHub in two files: **Activity-1.md** and **Activity-2.md**.
